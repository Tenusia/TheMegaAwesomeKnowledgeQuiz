  question: "What social classes did you have in viking society? At the top were
    the jarls, who made up the Viking nobility. They owned large amounts of land
    and livestock and dominated both the Viking government and society. Most Vikings
    belonged to the karls and were also known as freemen. They owned land and drove
    most of the daily workforce of Viking society. Finally, at the bottom were thralls
    \u2013 slaves who did all the menial labor in Viking society."
