  question: "Which day of the week was named after a famous Viking god? The great
    raven god Odin, otherwise known as Woden, gives us Wednesday (literally, Woden\u2019s
    Day). Meanwhile, Tuesday and Friday are named after Tyr and Frigg, the god and
    goddess of war and marriage, respectively. Finally, and possibly most famously,
    the Norse god of thunder and strength Thor gives us our Thursday."
