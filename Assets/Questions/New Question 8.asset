  question: "Was it possible to change your social rank in society? The mechanics
    are still unclear to scholars at this time, but it wasn\u2019t unknown for karls
    to become jarls. Even slaves had some rights. For example, they were still  treated
    as people and their owners couldn\u2019t kill them on a whim. Freed slaves became
    freedmen. While having fewer rights compared to karls, freedmen could own land
    of their own. Grandchildren of freedmen automatically became karls at birth."
