  question: What was a popular hobby of vikings? skieing. So important was the pastime
    to the vikings that they even worshipped a god in its name. Medieval sources
    have very limited material on the god Ullr, but he's almost always shown on skis
    carrying a bow. In one text, it is said that Ullr can be called ski-god, bow-god,
    hunting-god and shield-god.
