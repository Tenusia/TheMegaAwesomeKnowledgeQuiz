  question: 'What was very important for a viking? Despite how popular fiction shows
    them, Vikings did not go around with wild and unruly hair. Neatness of appearance
    was a mark of status in Viking society, with karls and jarls alike favoring a
    variety of hairstyles as shown in surviving pieces of Viking art.

    

    Jarls
    also liked to show off their wealth, usually with silk clothes imported from
    abroad and elaborate jewelry. Hygiene went hand-in-hand with neat appearances,
    and materials such as combs, brushes, and soaps were among the many funerary
    offerings found in Viking tombs. That last especially shows the importance Vikings
    placed on personal cleanliness.'
