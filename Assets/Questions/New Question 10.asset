  question: "What does a viking helmet look like? Well, we did say we\u2019d break
    the stereotype with Viking facts. They\u2019re often shown using them, most popularly
    in the operas mentioned before. Comics, cartoons, and other materials also show
    Vikings as universally wearing horned helmets.\r\n\r\nIn reality, Viking helmets
    weren\u2019t any different from other European helmets of the time. They were
    caps made from iron or steel, featuring a nasal guard to protect the head and
    nose."
